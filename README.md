OBDIIC&amp;C Bluetooth android app- The app is made for OBDIIC&C which connects to Honda Insight 2000-2006*. 
The obdIIC&C provides data from the cars computer related to the hybrid IMA system.
The app's goal is to project the data into an android app using gauges. 
This project is currently on hold as I sold my insight. 
If you are interested in using my code for continuing the project please contact me info_at_theturingsingularity.com
